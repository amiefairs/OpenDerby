### Why participate in open science?   

Why should you adopt open science practice? Open science means keeping your ideas, data, code and publications open access. This may seem scary initially, but [McKiernan et al. (2016)] (https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e16800) demonstrated that open research was associated with increases in **citations, collaborations, job and funding opportunities**.

Not only can open science help the individual researcher, but also it advances the field as a whole. Open science allows quicker and easier access to publications and also ensures reproducibility of studies. Reproducible science is imperative for the field and is  incredibly beneficial and helpful to the researcher themselves.
