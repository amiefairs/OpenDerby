### How to run a research derby?

#### First meeting, hypothesis, and Github

First, find a group of excited researchers (i.e. graduate students, post-docs, PIs) and meet to discuss research question possibilities and access to open data sets. 

Need an idea? See our [list of questions and datasets](https://github.com/jpwrobinson/OpenDerby/blob/master/4_research_qs_data.md) from researchers who are looking for collaborators!. 

Next, set up your Derby on GitHub. We recommend using a single public repository with every participant [added as a collaborator.](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/) 

Remember, this repository is your public holding place for all meeting notes, ideas, writing and datasets. In other words, your Open Notebook.

Once you have decided on a question/idea (this may take several meetings - stick at it!) and identified an appropriate open dataset you're ready to start the research process!

#### Data wrangling, literature review, and statistics 

Day-to-day derby tasks should be run however the Derby leader wishes. You might want to split up major tasks between individuals or pairs - data cleaning and exploring, literature review, testing statistical approaches. 

At this point, conduct your research in whichever framework is most familiar for you and your research group. BUT, however you decide to do it, make sure that every task is open!

We recommend the following breakdown:

For storing data, analysis, (e.g. R/Python/bash scripts), figures, and writing in reproducible text documents (e.g. R markdown, LaTeX): pull, add, commit, and push through GitHub. 

[Github's large file storage system](https://git-lfs.github.com/) might be useful for Derby's working with large datasets.

For the literature review: we've found that Google sheets are great ways of gathering notes. You could also use [Mendeley's online Groups feature](https://www.mendeley.com/) to keep papers organised.

#### Communicating throughout the Derby

Derbies may be run by groups that share offices, or by people living on different continents. Either way, it's incredibly useful to keep a record of every conversation and every decision you make during a research project. There are lots of ways to do this, some of our favourites are:

* We like using [Slack](https://slack.com/) for keeping everyone updated/messaging eachother   
* We also like using the [Issues](https://github.com/baumlab/open-science-project/issues) in GitHub to keep track of problems and decisions  
* [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/) is a great tool for structuring video calls and keeping track of discussion

#### Writing manuscript and submission

When you've finished writing up your findings, publish your manuscript in an open access journal! 

Need inspiration? Check our [resources page.](https://github.com/jpwrobinson/OpenDerby/5_resources.md) Some high impact journals have started to offer open access options (but often for a fee), or you could consider using a preprint server (such as [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/)) while submitting to the journal of your choice.
