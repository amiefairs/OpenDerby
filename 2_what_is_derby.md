#### What is an Open Research Derby?

In a Research Derby, researchers collaborate together over 24 hours to solve an unanswered science problem. Researchers are often graduate students from one university department or lab group - for example, the Earth-2-Ocean group at Simon Fraser University who published their analysis of XX. 

We extend this concept with Open Derby: solving an unanswered science problem in **open** collaboration. Participants will combine open data, Github, and R-markdown in an **open notebook** to ensure their findings are reproducible and openly available.  



The Derby should be flexible for your research needs. We are a group of quantitative ecologists who are familiar with analysing large observational datasets

 analyse data in R (or your other favourite open source statistics software)
write the manuscript in RMarkdown (or GoogleDocs, or XX, or xX)


publish all project development in an open notebook (we like Github)
submit your manuscript to an open access journal (or preprint server and any journal you choose)
