Dear ....

My name is James etc....

I'm developing an open science project for Mozilla's Open Leadership training programme called Open Derby. The project aims to convert entire lab groups into practicing open science, while promoting open notebooks, data sharing, and reproducibility. 

In an Open Derby, a group of graduate students answer a novel research question by analyzing open data in R and/or Python, writing a manuscript in R markdown, and submitting their findings to an open access journal. Participants would learn how to use open tools in their own research, get an open access publication, and gain valuable experience in collaborating with their peers on non-thesis projects.

I believe that Open Derby can substantially improve the uptake and standard of open science practiced by researchers, and further advertise the benefits of working openly.

I'm writing to ask whether you would be interested in contributing open data and open research questions to the project. Research derbies can fail when groups cannot identify a testable hypothesis, either because data is lacking or because the question is poorly defined. I would like to offer a central repository of potential derby research questions with accompanying dataset(s)

Christie Bahlai.....use as an example.

Stress giving the data + question, rather than participating.....
