### What is open science?   

Open science is the idea of keeping your ideas, data, code and publications open access. Some examples:

- **Ideas**: The most straight forward way to make your ideas open access would be to publish them in an online notebook. This could take the form of a blog or a markdown file in Github.
- **Data**: Data collected for a project, or data gathered from other sources, can be made available freely on the web. A number of websites (list here) can now be used to archive data used in papers. This is even required for some journals prior to publication.
- **Code**: Code affiliated with a research project can be archived and tracked with services like Github. This allows monitoring of how code changes over time. Further, other people can either use your code or suggest improvements.
- **Publications**: Numerous outlets now exist to publish a research paper open access, from open access journals and hosting on personal websites to university repositories and preprint servers.

Open science is not binary (i.e. closed versus open) but a spectrum from paywalled, closed data manuscripts to a fully-reproducible open-access analysis. With open derby, you get to choose how open you want your research to be.

### Why open science?

Sharing your ideas freely may seem scary initially, but  many researchers have shown that open science practices can benefit you, your research, and your field. 

For your career, [McKiernan et al. (2016)](https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e16800) demonstrated that open research was associated with increases in **citations, collaborations, job and funding opportunities**.

For your personal life, [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) will tell you that keeping everything version controlled will save you hours of wasted work, allow others to use your data and code, and help you to start coding reproducible scripts. 

Not only can open science help the individual researcher, but also it advances the field as a whole. Open science allows quicker and easier access to publications [REF] and also ensures reproducibility of studies [REF]. So, reproducible science is imperative for any scientific field - we want to speed up the transition from closed to open.
