# OpenDerby

#### What is Open Derby?

Open Derby solves an unanswered science problem in **open** collaboration. Participants will combine open data, Github, and R-markdown in an **open notebook** to ensure their findings are reproducible and openly available.  

We've written a short manual explaining what OpenDerby is, and how you can adapt it for your own open needs.

#### How can I use Open Derby?

Does your lab do open science? Interested in learning open science tools while publishing openly and getting course credit? We encourage senior PhD students, post-docs, and PIs to host an Open Derby at their institution - more details on running your own event **here**. 

Although each derby will be unique, we encourage participants to share their open insights: 

* which tools worked well for your lab group?
* how did you write the manuscript?
* did you find any interesting datasets?

Please contribute to the Open Derby material by **forking** this repository. If you'd like to become more involved with the project, email James Robinson for direct write access.
