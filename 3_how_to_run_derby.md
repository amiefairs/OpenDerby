#### How to run a research derby?


1) First, find a group of excited researchers (i.e. graduate students, post-docs, PIs)  
2) Meet virtually and/or in person to discuss research question possibilities and access to open data sets (OR see our page [research qs data](https://github.com/jpwrobinson/OpenDerby/blob/master/4_research_qs_data.md) for questions + datasets from researchers that don't have time to analyze them!)  
3) Set everyone up on GitHub  
4) Keep all meeting notes, ideas, writing and datasets within the public GitHub repository   

* We like using [Slack](https://slack.com/) for keeping everyone updated/messaging eachother   
* We also like using the [Issues](https://github.com/baumlab/open-science-project/issues) in GitHub to keep track of any problems or decisions  

5) Once you have decided on a question/idea, split up tasks and maintain version control automatically through GitHub  
6) Once finished, publish your findings in an open access journal!
