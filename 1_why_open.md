### What is open science?   

Open science is the idea of keeping your ideas, data, code and publications open access. Here is an example for each open access component:

- Ideas: The most straight forward way to make your ideas open access would be to publish them in an online notebook. This could take the form of a blog or a markdown file in Github.
- Data: Data collected for a project, or data gathered from other sources, can be made available freely on the web. A number of websites (list here) can now be used to archive data used in papers. This is even required for some journals prior to publication.
- Code: Code affiliated with a research project can be archived and tracked with services like Github. This allows monitoring of how code changes over time. Further, other people can either use your code or suggest improvements.
- Publications: Numerous outlets now exist to publish a research paper open access. These outlets can take the form of an open access journal, a university repository, or a preprint server.

Open science is not a binary measurement: closed versus open. Instead, your work can fall on a spectrum from not open to more open. 

### Why open science?

The idea of open science may seem scary initially, but [McKiernan et al. (2016)] (https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e16800) demonstrated that open research was associated with increases in **citations, collaborations, job and funding opportunities**.

Not only can open science help the individual researcher, but also it advances the field as a whole. Open science allows quicker and easier access to publications and also ensures reproducibility of studies. Reproducible science is imperative for the field and is  incredibly beneficial and helpful to the researcher themselves.
