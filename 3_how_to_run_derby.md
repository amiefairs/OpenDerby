#### How to run a research derby?

1) Find a group of excited researchers  
2) Meet virtually and/or in person to discuss research question possibilities and access to open data sets  
3) Set everyone up on GitHub!  
4) Keep all meeting notes, ideas, writing and datasets within the public Git repository  
5) Once you have decided on a question/idea, split up tasks and maintain version control automatically through GitHub  
6) Once finished, publish your findings in an open access journal!
