## Ideas and datasets for Derby projects

The most difficult part of running a research derby can be devising a tractable research question that 1) has data and 2) fits the expertise of the derby group. 

To help you get started, we've come up with a list of open datasets, papers to read for inspiration, and projects contributed by open collaborators.

**Lake warming and endangered species**

![alt text](/images/lake-dataset-map.jpg "")

[O'Reilly et al. (2015)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL066235/full) described the global warming of surface temperatures for 291 lakes over 1985-2009. The authors published their dataset, with accompanying climate and geomorphometric characteristics for each lake. 

[Dr. Stephanie Hampton](https://cereo.wsu.edu/hampton-bio/) suggested that an Open Derby team might investigate the distribution of endangered species among lakes and warming profiles. Endangered species data for lake habitats are provided by the IUCN Red List. Check under Habitats/Wetlands for lake-specific species.

*If you decide to pick this project, please contact Stephanie to let her know you're interested in her idea. Stephanie and her lake warming colleagues will be coauthors (or however you agree to work together).*
