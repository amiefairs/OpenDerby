#### What is an Open Research Derby?

In a Research Derby, researchers collaborate together over 24 hours to solve an unanswered science problem [Favaro et al. 2013](../resources/papers/Favaroetal_2013.pdf). Past derbies have been run by graduate students from a university department or lab group who share research interests and collaborate regularly. For example, ecology graduate students at Simon Fraser University ran a 24 hour derby and eventually published their analysis of digitized texts to identify pathways to conservation success. 

We extend this concept with Open Derby: solving an unanswered science problem in open collaboration. Participants combine open data, Github, and R-markdown in an **open notebook** - so ensuring that their findings are reproducible and openly available - and submit their findings to an open access journal or (for higher impact journals) a preprint server.

The original derby concept was developed for quantitative ecologists - we tend to analyse data in R, and feel more comfortable writing in R-markdown than LaTex. Other researchers may work with different open tools (such as Jupyter or LaTex) and **we stress that the Derby should be flexible for your research needs.**

#### Our 6 point Open Derby checklist:

1. gather open data to test a novel research question  
2. create open notebook in a public Github repository  
3. keep literature review open and editable (we like Google Sheets)  
4. analyse data with open source statistical software (we like R)  
5. write manuscript in a reproducible, open source format (we like Rmarkdown)  
6. submit your manuscript to an open access journal (or preprint server and any journal you choose)
